/**
 * Calling methods in intervals is not a good idea to do with EJB timer service.
 * The EJB timer service can not handle time shift because it always stores the last execution timestamp.
 * <p>
 * So EJB timers are a good choice when you want to execute methods on a datetime like every day at 2 am.
 * <p>
 * It's a {@link Singleton} and exists only once per application server and as a {@link Startup} EJB
 * it's started when the application is deployed and started.
 * <p>
 * For intervals the {@link ManagedScheduledExecutorService} is the right choice.
 * <p>
 * <strong>HINT!</strong>
 * You should use Singletons with caution because they could lead to locks and waits.
 * The default {@link javax.ejb.LockType} is WRITE and therefor all the methods calls are serialized.
