/**
 * Configures the CustomerCache.
 * <p>
 * Caching is a common performance optimization strategy.
 * But with every performance optimization strategy caching has advantages and disadvantage.
 * Some of the disadvantages are the lost of statelessness. That will break distribution and scaling that are
 * very important in the age of cloud computing.
 * <p>
 * As Donald Knutt said in 1974:
 * "Premature optimization is the root of all evil..."
 * <p>
 * So think twice before you start using caching. Usually the database is fast enough if you use it in a
 * optimal way like reducing SQL statements by using DTOs instead of entities and imprving data access
 * with indexing.
